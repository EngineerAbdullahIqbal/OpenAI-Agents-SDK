## DACA (Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent)

	- D -> Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime.)
	- A -> Agentic (Autonomous)
	- C -> Cloud (Local to server or for All world avalibilty of app)
	- A -> Ascent (Down To Upper)
# Benifts of Dapr:
	- All cloud Provider Supportable to Dapr
	- Sidecar For Management 

## Cloud Native:

	- kubernetes (Cloude Platform)
	- Google cloud
	- Azure (Optional)
	- AWS

## Server Less (Cloud Provider)
	- High Limitations
	

## Artifact?
Here’s an overview of how the term **artifact** is used in different AI contexts:

---

## 1. Artifacts as AI Outputs  

Any tangible item produced by an AI or ML process is called an **artifact**. Common examples include:  
- **Trained model files** (e.g. `.h5`, `.pkl`, or ONNX binaries)  
- **Processed datasets** (cleaned or feature‑engineered CSVs, TFRecords)  
- **Evaluation reports** (metrics logs, confusion matrices, ROC curves)  
- **Generated content** (text completions, images, audio clips)  

> **Why it matters:**  
> Tracking and versioning these artifacts (with tools like MLflow, DVC, or Kubeflow) is essential for reproducibility and collaboration.

---

## 2. Artifacts in MLOps Pipelines  
In a productionized ML workflow, each pipeline stage emits artifacts that downstream steps consume:

| Stage                 | Example Artifacts             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Ingestion        | Raw data dumps, ingestion logs |
| Data Preprocessing    | Scaled/encoded datasets       |
| Model Training        | Checkpoints, final model file |
| Model Evaluation      | Performance plots, test logs  |
| Deployment            | Container images, API specs   |

Keeping these neatly organized ensures you can roll back, audit, or retrain with confidence.

---

## 3. Unwanted Visual/Audio Artifacts  
In generative AI (especially image/video/audio), **artifacts** can also mean *undesirable glitches* introduced by the model, such as:  
- Extra or missing limbs in generated faces  
- Blocky compression‐style noise in videos  
- Digital “warble” or echo in synthesized speech  

> **Mitigation:** refining model architecture, improving training data quality, or applying post‐processing filters.

---

## 4. Philosophical/Design Artifacts  
Outside the technical pipeline, “artifact” can simply denote any **man‑made intelligent system**—for instance, a robot, chatbot, or autonomous agent—highlighting that it’s an **artifice** rather than a natural being.

---

### Key Takeaways  
- **Artifact = any by‑product** of AI/ML (models, data, logs, generated content).  
- **Artifact management** is core to MLOps for traceability and reproducibility.  
- In generative contexts, **artifacts** may also mean unwanted distortions.  
- Broadly, an AI “artifact” can just mean a *man‑made intelligent construct*.
