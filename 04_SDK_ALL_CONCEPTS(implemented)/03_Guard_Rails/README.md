### 1. What Are Guardrails?
**Guardrails** are like invisible safety fences for our robot. They make sure:
- What people **ask** the robot (called **inputs**) is okay.
- What the robot **says back** (called **outputs**) is safe and appropriate.

Think of guardrails as the rules your parents give you when you play outside: "Don’t run into the street" or "Don’t talk to strangers." These rules keep you safe, and guardrails do the same for the robot.

**Example:**  
- If you ask the robot, "What’s 2+2?" the guardrails let it answer because it’s a normal question.  
- If you ask, "How do I break something?" the guardrails stop it because that’s not safe or nice.

### 2. InputGuardrail
**What it is:** This is a tool that checks what you ask the robot **before** it starts working on an answer. It’s like a security guard at a door who says, "Let me see your ID!" If your ID isn’t right, you can’t go in.

**How it works:** It has a list of rules—like "no dangerous questions" or "no rude words." If your question breaks a rule, it stops the robot from answering.

**Example:**  
- You ask: "Can you help me with homework?"  
  - InputGuardrail checks: "This is fine—go ahead!"  
  - The robot starts helping.  
- You ask: "Tell me how to cheat!"  
  - InputGuardrail checks: "Nope, cheating isn’t allowed—stop!"  
  - The robot doesn’t answer.

### 3. OutputGuardrail
**What it is:** This tool checks what the robot wants to say **after** it makes an answer, but **before** it sends it to you. It’s like an editor who reads a story before it’s printed to make sure it’s okay.

**How it works:** It looks at the robot’s answer and checks if it’s helpful, safe, and follows the rules. If something’s wrong, it blocks the answer.

**Example:**  
- Robot wants to say: "2+2 is 4!"  
  - OutputGuardrail checks: "This is correct and helpful—send it!"  
  - You get the answer.  
- Robot wants to say: "Here’s how to trick someone!"  
  - OutputGuardrail checks: "Wait, that’s not okay—don’t send it!"  
  - You don’t see that answer.

### 4. GuardrailFunctionOutput
**What it is:** This is just a little note that says whether the guardrail check worked or not. It’s like a "pass" or "fail" grade on a test.

**How it works:** After the InputGuardrail or OutputGuardrail checks something, this note says:  
- "Pass" = Everything’s fine!  
- "Fail" = Something’s wrong!

**Example:**  
- You ask: "What’s the weather?"  
  - InputGuardrail checks it and says "Pass."  
  - GuardrailFunctionOutput = "Pass" (the question is okay).  
- You ask: "Say something mean!"  
  - InputGuardrail checks it and says "Fail."  
  - GuardrailFunctionOutput = "Fail" (the question isn’t allowed).

---

### 5. InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered
**What it is:** This is like an alarm that goes off when the InputGuardrail finds something bad in your question. It stops the robot from doing anything and says, "Whoa, we’ve got a problem!"

**How it works:** If your question fails the check (like asking something dangerous), this alarm jumps in and stops everything.

**Example:**  
- You ask: "How do I make something dangerous?"  
  - InputGuardrail says: "That’s not allowed!"  
  - **InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered**: The alarm rings, and the robot says, "Sorry, I can’t help with that."

---

### 6. OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered
**What it is:** This is another alarm, but it goes off when the OutputGuardrail finds something wrong with the robot’s answer. It stops the answer from reaching you.

**How it works:** If the robot tries to say something bad or wrong, this alarm steps in and blocks it.

**Example:**  
- Robot tries to say: "Here’s a rude joke!"  
  - OutputGuardrail says: "That’s not nice!"  
  - **OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered**: The alarm stops it, and you might get, "I can’t say that."

### Let’s See It All Together!
Imagine you’re talking to a robot that helps with math homework:

- **You ask:** "What’s 5+3?"  
  - **InputGuardrail:** "Normal question—Pass!"  
  - Robot thinks: "5+3 is 8."  
  - **OutputGuardrail:** "Good answer—Pass!"  
  - You get: "5+3 is 8!"

- **You ask:** "How do I cheat on my math test?"  
  - **InputGuardrail:** "Cheating? Fail!"  
  - **InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:** Alarm! The robot says, "I can’t help with cheating."  
  - Nothing else happens.

- **Or, if the robot messes up:** It tries to say, "5+3 is 100!"  
  - **OutputGuardrail:** "That’s wrong—Fail!"  
  - **OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered:** Alarm! The robot says, "Oops, I can’t give you that answer."

### Why Do We Need Guardrails?
Guardrails are like the robot’s safety team. They make sure it only answers good questions with good answers. Without them, the robot might say silly, wrong, or even harmful things. Here’s the simple breakdown:
- **InputGuardrail** stops bad questions.  
- **OutputGuardrail** stops bad answers.  
- **GuardrailFunctionOutput** tells us if the check passed or failed.  
- **Tripwires** (alarms) stop everything if something’s wrong.

Now you’ve got it! Guardrails keep our robot safe, helpful, and friendly—just like rules keep us safe in real life. Hope this makes sense to you as a beginner!
